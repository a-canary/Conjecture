## Learnings
<!-- Distilled lessons. Pruned when stale. -->
- **Tags are LLM-generated**: Users don't create tags directly. LLM creates tags when creating claims. Split: >20% usage → sample 100 → LLM suggests ≤8 replacements → batch 20 → LLM assigns per claim. Merge: >500 total.
- **Root context = single claim**: Full conversation stored as one claim, decomposed into supporting claims. Halt when root is clean + LLM satisfied. No fixed eval limit.
- **Dirty cascades upward only**: When claim changes, mark all `.supers` dirty. Never mark `.subs`. Unidirectional toward root context.
- **Relationship naming**: `supers` = claims this provides evidence FOR (toward root). `subs` = claims that provide evidence FOR this (children). Reflects decomposition model.
- **Counter-claims are implicit**: LLM naturally creates alternatives when questioning validity. No formal system needed — just fallacy awareness.
- **5-scope model**: SESSION, WORKSPACE, USER (LLM assigns) → TEAM, PUBLIC (LLM suggests, requires approval).
- **Claude Agent SDK**: Primary LLM provider. Handles secrets. Default: Haiku 4.5. Custom endpoints via JSON config.

## Known Issues
<!-- Recurring failures, provider errors, environment quirks -->
- ~~**Rename needed**: `supports` → `supers`, `supported_by` → `subs`~~ **FIXED 2026-02-24**
- ~~**dirty_flag.py line 98**: bidirectional cascade~~ **FIXED 2026-02-24** — Now unidirectional to supers only
- ~~**GAP-1: Missing repositories.py**~~ **FIXED 2026-02-25** — Created with ClaimRepository, RepositoryFactory
- ~~**GAP-2: Database stubs**~~ **FIXED 2026-02-25** — OptimizedSQLiteManager fully implemented with async CRUD
- ~~**GAP-3: Process layer 0% coverage**~~ **COMPLETE 2026-02-27** — All 3 modules at excellent coverage: models.py 97.96%, context_builder 91.07%, llm_processor 99.22%
- ~~**GAP-4: FastAPI missing**~~ **FIXED 2026-02-25** — Added fastapi/uvicorn to requirements, fixed SimpleProcessingInterface usage
- **Git push blocked**: SSH key not configured — requires user to configure SSH keys or use HTTPS
- **Python venv required**: Use `/workspace/.venv/bin/python` for testing
