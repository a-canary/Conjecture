Success requires not just raw accuracy but demonstrable value through clear UX, cost comparison, and academic-grade methodology.",
  
  "reasoning": "Despite 7B model constraints (vs 70B+ frontier models), the user experience can be excellent through: (1) Smart UX design that abstracts model limits behind clean APIs and real-time reasoning traces, (2) Transparent cost comparison ($0 local vs $200+ cloud), (3) Seamless integration with existing development workflows, (4) Publication-ready export formats, (5) Easy model switching for comparison. The combination transforms a technical limitation into a competitive advantage.",
