Experiment ID: 9cfb87b9

## Executive Summary

**Hypothesis:** Claims-based reasoning will show 15%+ improvement in correctness and confidence calibration
**Sample Size:** 10 direct, 10 claims-based
**Model:** lms/granite-4-h-tiny

**Hypothesis Validated:** ❌ NO

## Performance Improvements

### Correctness
- **Direct Approach:** 0.813
- **Claims-Based Approach:** 0.780
- **Improvement:** -4.0%
- **Target Met (15%+):** ❌ No

### Confidence Calibration
- **Direct Approach:** 0.667
- **Claims-Based Approach:** 0.755
- **Improvement:** 13.1%
- **Target Met (15%+):** ❌ No

## Conclusions

❌ **HYPOTHESIS NOT VALIDATED**: Claims-based reasoning did not achieve the target 15%+ improvement in both primary metrics.

While some improvements may be observed, they do not meet the practical significance thresholds.
Further refinement of the claims-based approach may be needed.
