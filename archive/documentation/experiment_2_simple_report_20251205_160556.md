# Experiment 2: Enhanced Prompt Engineering - Simple Test Results

## Executive Summary

**Hypothesis**: Chain-of-thought examples and confidence calibration guidance will increase claim creation thoroughness by 25%

**Test Date**: 2025-12-05 16:05:56

**Target Metrics**:
- Claims per task: 1.2 -> 2.5+ (108% improvement)
- Quality improvement: >15%
- Confidence calibration error: <0.2

## Results Overview

### Performance Comparison

| Metric | Baseline | Enhanced | Improvement |
|---------|----------|----------|------------|
| Claims per task | 2.0 | 3.3 | 66.7% |
| Quality score | 67.7 | 81.0 | 19.7% |
| Calibration error | 0.35 | 0.15 | 57.1% |

### Success Criteria Analysis

- **Claims per task target (>=2.5)**: MET
- **Quality improvement target (>15%)**: MET
- **Calibration error target (<0.2)**: MET

## Conclusions

SUPPORTED: Enhanced prompt engineering shows significant improvement meeting all success criteria

## Recommendations

Based on the experimental results:

1. **If hypothesis supported**: Deploy enhanced templates to production environment
2. **If partially supported**: Refine enhanced templates and retest with larger sample
3. **If hypothesis rejected**: Investigate alternative prompt engineering approaches
