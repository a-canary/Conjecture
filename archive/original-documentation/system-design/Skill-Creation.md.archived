# Skill Creation - Capability Gap Detection and Expansion

## Executive Summary

Skill Creation transforms Conjecture from a fixed capability system to a self-improving ecosystem that automatically detects capability gaps and generates new skills through user-guided creation. The system maintains control through approval workflows while continuously expanding its capability set to meet evolving user needs.

## Core Philosophy

### Continuous Capability Evolution

Traditional AI systems have static tool sets that require manual updates for new capabilities. Skill Creation implements continuous capability evolution where the system identifies gaps, proposes solutions, and integrates new skills through user-approved workflows.

### User-Controlled Expansion

While the system automatically detects gaps and creates proposals, users retain complete control through explicit approval workflows. This balances autonomous capability growth with security and alignment with user goals.

## Skill Gap Detection

### Gap Detection Algorithm

Skill gaps are identified through systematic analysis of query-to-skill matching confidence:

```
Gap Detection Process:
Query Processing → Action Generation → Skills Registry Matching → Confidence Scoring
├─ Generate semantic action descriptions from query context
├─ Match actions against all available skills using embedding similarity
├─ Calculate confidence scores for each match
└─ Gap Detection: ALL matches < threshold
```

### Gap Threshold Criteria

Skill gaps are triggered when multiple conditions are met:

```
Gap Detection Thresholds:
├─ Highest skill confidence < 30%
├─ Multiple skills available but none > 40% semantic similarity
├─ Query hints present but no relevant skills found
└─ Critical intent keywords with no matching capabilities
```

### Gap Validation Process

Before triggering skill creation, the system validates genuine gaps:

```
Gap Validation:
├─ Retry query processing with expanded search parameters
├─ Check for alternative skill combinations
├─ Verify query clarity and proper action generation
└─ Confirm no existing skills can be adapted or combined
```

## Child Query Generation

### Skill Brainstorming Query Creation

When skill gaps are confirmed, the system generates a specialized child query:

```
Parent Query: "Analyze cross-platform mobile app performance metrics"

Gap Analysis:
├─ Available skills focus on web analytics and desktop applications
├─ No mobile-specific performance analysis capabilities
├─ Cross-platform analysis requires specialized tools
└─ Gap confirmed: Mobile analytics capabilities missing

Child Query Generated:
<query id="q75.5" intent="Brainstorm mobile analytics skills">
Brainstorm 4 new generalized skills to help with analyzing cross-platform mobile app performance metrics, including iOS and Android platforms
</query>
```

### Query Structuring

Child queries for skill creation follow specific structural requirements:

```
Skill Creation Query Structure:
├─ Clear capability gap description
├─ Specific target domain and context
├─ Request for 4 generalized skill proposals
├─ Emphasis on practical applicability
└─ Integration considerations with existing capabilities
```

## Skill Proposal Generation

### LLM Skill Brainstorming

The skill brainstorming query generates concrete skill proposals through structured LLM processing:

```
LLM Generation Process:
├─ Analyze capability gap in detail
├─ Review existing skills to avoid duplication
├─ Consider practical implementation approaches
├─ Generate 4 skill proposals with complete specifications
└─ Format proposals for user evaluation
```

### Skill Proposal Format

Generated skill proposals include complete specifications:

```
Skill Proposal Format:
<skill_proposal name="mobile_analytics"
              description="Unified cross-platform analytics collector for mobile app performance metrics"
              capabilities="Data collection from iOS/Android apps, performance monitoring, user behavior tracking"
              execution_path="python"
              permissions="network_access, user_consent"
              dependencies="data_processor, visualization_tools"
              implementation_complexity="medium"
              potential_uses="App performance optimization, user experience analysis, competitive benchmarking"/>
```

### Proposal Quality Criteria

Generated proposals must meet quality standards:

```
Quality Requirements:
├─ Clear, actionable descriptions with specific capabilities
├─ Realistic implementation complexity assessment
├─ Appropriate permission declarations
├─ Identified dependencies on existing skills
├─ Practical use cases and applications
└─ Differentiation from existing capabilities
```

## User Approval Workflow

### Skill Creation Request Format

The system presents skill creation requests through a structured interface:

```
<skill_creation_request query_id="q75.5" requires_approval="true"
                        detected_gap="Mobile app performance analytics"
                        parent_query="Analyze cross-platform mobile app performance metrics">
<capability_gap_analysis>
Current system lacks specialized mobile app analytics capabilities. Existing web analytics and desktop monitoring tools cannot address mobile-specific performance metrics, cross-platform data collection, or mobile user behavior patterns.

<user_prompt>Which skills should be created to resolve this capability gap? Select multiple options. You can also modify skill descriptions before approval.</user_prompt>
</skill_creation_request>
```

### User Interaction Options

Users have multiple interaction options:

```
User Approval Options:
├─ Approve Selected Skills → Generate skill.md files
├─ Modify Proposals → Edit descriptions or parameters
├─ Request Refinement → Ask for alternative proposals
├─ Reject All → No skills created, gap remains
└─ Defer Decision → Mark for later consideration
```

## Skill Integration Process

### Skill File Generation

Approved proposals are converted into complete skill.md files:

```
Skill Generation Process:
├─ Extract approved proposal specifications
├─ Generate complete skill.md structure
├─ Create YAML frontmatter with tool definitions
├─ Add markdown documentation sections
├─ Validate schema and permissions
└─ Generate unique skill IDs and metadata
```
