# Resolution Context - Resolution Statements and Context Gathering

## Executive Summary

Resolution Context transforms AI systems from conversation compression with semantic drift to structured milestone tracking that maintains operational lineage through resolution statements. The system provides focused, curated context for future operations through hybrid gathering strategies that combine direct child relevance with recent operational awareness, enabling efficient processing without losing critical operational insights.

## Core Philosophy

### Milestone-Based Continuity Over Conversation Memory

Traditional systems maintain conversation history that grows unbounded, introducing semantic drift and context management complexity. Resolution Context maintains structured milestones that document intent, actions, and outcomes, providing precise operational lineage without conversational overhead.

### Focused Context Gathering

Instead of storing complete conversation histories, Resolution Context selectively gathers the most relevant resolution statements through hybrid strategies that prioritize direct lineage while maintaining operational awareness through recent activity tracking.

## Resolution Statement Architecture

### Statement Format and Structure

Resolution statements capture the semantic progression of operations through standardized XML format that provides structured documentation of query progress and outcomes.

```xml
<resolution query_id="q42"
           intent="Analyze quantum entanglement applications in secure communications"
           timestamp="2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
           parent_id="q_root_001">
actions="Generated statistical analysis of quantum limitations, created visualizations of no-communication theorem applications"
progress="Completed comprehensive analysis with 85% confidence using peer-reviewed studies and experimental data"
impact="Query resolved, spawned 2 follow-up queries on practical implementation and regulatory compliance"
claims_referenced="c142,c89,c156"
tools_executed="analyze_quantum_data, create_visualization, research_best_practices"
confidence_score="0.85"
</resolution>
```

### Statement Components

**Core Attributes**:
- **query_id**: Unique identifier for the resolved query
- **intent**: High-level description of the query's original objective
- **timestamp**: System-generated timestamp of resolution completion
- **parent_id**: Reference to parent query for lineage tracking

**Progress Documentation**:
- **actions**: Specific actions performed during resolution
- **progress**: Detailed outcome description with confidence assessment
- **impact**: Effects on the broader research context and follow-up activities
- **claims_referenced**: Links to specific evidence claims used in resolution
- **tools_executed**: Record of tools utilized during processing

### System-Generated Metadata

Resolution statements include system-managed metadata to ensure consistency and traceability:

- **Timestamp Generation**: Automatic timestamp creation at resolution completion
- **Parent Relationship Tracking**: Hierarchical relationship maintenance
- **Claim Linkage**: Automatic cross-referencing with supporting claims
- **Tool Execution Tracking**: Complete audit trail of used capabilities

## Hybrid Context Gathering Strategy

### Context Assembly Algorithm

The hybrid context gathering strategy combines two complementary sources to optimize relevance and efficiency:

```
Context Assembly Process:
Query q75 Processing → Child Resolution Collection → Recent Resolution Selection → Context Integration
├─ Direct Child Resolutions (Priority: High) → Immediate lineage relevance
├─ Recent Resolutions (Priority: Medium) → Operational awareness
├─ Context Window Management → Optimize within token limits
└─ Balanced Integration → Maintain both lineage and awareness
```

### Direct Child Resolution Collection

First priority is collecting all direct child resolution statements:

```xml
Direct Child Resolutions (Priority: High):
<resolution query_id="q75.1" timestamp="2024-01-15T10:25:00Z">
Initial data validation completed using claims c89, c90 with 95% confidence
Identified segments A (23% churn) and C (18% churn) as high-risk areas
Claims generated: c92-c94, tools executed: validate_data, segment_analysis
</resolution>

<resolution query_id="q75.2" timestamp="2024-01-15T10:28:00Z">
Industry benchmark research completed using external sources s45-s48
Competitive practices documented in claims c95-c98 with 75% confidence
Tools executed: research_industry_trends, analyze_competitors
</resolution>

<resolution query_id="q75.3" timestamp="2024-01-15T10:29:00Z">
Preliminary retention strategies developed based on segment analysis
Strategy recommendations stored in claims c99-c102 with 80% confidence
Tools executed: develop_strategies, calculate_roi, assess_risks
</resolution>
```

### Recent Resolution Selection

After collecting direct children, the system fills remaining context slots with the most recent resolution statements:

```xml
Recent Resolutions (Priority: Medium):
<resolution query_id="q42" timestamp="2024-01-15T10:15:00Z">
Quantum entanglement analysis completed using claims c142, c89 with 85% confidence
No-communication theorem limitations documented for practical applications
</resolution>

<resolution query_id="q38" timestamp="2024-01-15T10:10:00Z">
Customer satisfaction survey analysis completed with confidence 0.78
Key insights stored in claims c80-c84, improvement priorities identified
Tools executed: analyze_surveys, identify_priorities
</resolution>
```

### Context Window Optimization

The system manages context window constraints through intelligent selection:

```
Context Management Strategy:
├─ Total Resolution Target: 8-10 statements maximum
├─ Child Priority: First 5-6 slots reserved for direct children
├─ Recent Priority: Remaining 3-4 slots for recent statements
├─ Relevance Scoring: Semantic similarity to current query
└─ Size Optimization: Truncate verbose descriptions if needed
```

## Integration with Processing Cycle

### Prompt Structure Integration

Resolution statements are integrated into prompt structure before evidence data:

```
Complete Prompt Structure:
1. System Instructions
2. Resolution Context (Hybrid Gathering)
   ├─ Direct Child Resolutions (with claim references)
   ├─ Recent Resolutions (operational awareness)
   └─ Total: 8-10 statements maximum
3. Evidence Data (claims with confidence and sources)
4. Thread Notes (accumulated methodology)
5. Current Query with progress tracking
```

### Cross-Reference System

Resolution statements maintain relationships across the system:

```
Cross-Reference Mapping:
├─ Query Links → Parent-child relationship tracking
├─ Claim References → Evidence linkage for traceability
├─ Tool Execution Records → Capability usage history
├─ Resolution Impact → Follow-up query generation
└─ Performance Metrics → Success rate tracking
```

## Performance Optimization

### Indexing Strategy

Resolution statements support efficient retrieval through multiple indexes:

```
Indexing Architecture:
├─ Query ID Index → Rapid resolution lookup by query
├─ Timestamp Index → Chronological access for recent gathering
├─ Parent Relationship Index → Child resolution collection
├─ Claim Reference Index → Evidence linkage optimization
└─ Execution History Index → Performance analysis support
```

### Caching Strategy

Frequently accessed resolution statements are cached for performance:

```
Caching Optimization:
├─ Hot Resolution Cache → Recently accessed statements
├─ Relationship Cache → Parent-child relationship data
├─ Claim Link Cache → Frequently referenced claim connections
└─ Performance Cache → Resolution success patterns
```

## Quality Assurance

### Resolution Validation

System validates resolution statements for completeness and consistency:

```
Validation Checklist:
├─ Required Fields Present → query_id, intent, timestamp
├─ Parent Relationship Valid → Verified parent query exists
├─ Claim References Accurate → All referenced claims exist
├─ Tool Execution Complete → All referenced tools executed successfully
├─ Confidence Score Reasonable → Within expected ranges
├─ Impact Description Clear → Logical connection to actions
└─ Timestamp Consistent → Chronological order maintained
```

### Consistency Checking

Cross-resolution consistency is maintained through validation:

```
Consistency Validation:
├─ Claim Resolution Consistency → No contradictory claim usage
├─ Parent-Child Relationship Validity → Circular dependency prevention
├─ Timeline Consistency → Logical temporal progression
├─ Success Rate Tracking → Resolution pattern analysis
└─ Impact Assessment Accuracy → Reasonable impact descriptions
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Resolution Generation Errors

```
Error Management:
├─ Incomplete Data → Use available information, note gaps
├─ Missing Claims → Proceed without claim references
├─ Tool Execution Failures → Document errors, continue resolution
├─ Confidence Calculation Errors → Use conservative estimates
└─ System Timestamp Issues → Manual override with approximate times
```

### Context Assembly Errors

```
Recovery Strategies:
├─ Resolution Unavailable → Skip to next available statement
├─ Context Window Overflow → Intelligent truncation with key point preservation
├─ Index Failures → Linear search fallback
├─ Relationship Errors → Proceed without resolution linking
└─ Performance Issues → Reduce resolution count temporarily
```

## Success Metrics
