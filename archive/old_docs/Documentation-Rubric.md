## 📋 **Evaluation Process**

### **Phase 1: Document Scoring**
1. Rate each document against all 6 criteria
2. Calculate total score for each document
3. Identify specific improvement areas
4. Prioritize documents by impact and effort

### **Phase 2: Iterative Improvement**
1. Address lowest-scoring criteria first
2. Rewrite sections to meet rubric standards
3. Validate improvements maintain accuracy
4. Re-score until target achieved

### **Phase 3: Consistency Review**
1. Cross-reference all improved documents
2. Ensure consistency across documentation set
3. Validate DRY principle adherence
4. Final quality assurance check

## 🎯 **Success Targets**

### **Minimum Standards**
- **All documents**: ≥ 80 points (Good quality)
- **Core documents**: ≥ 90 points (Excellent quality)
- **DRY compliance**: ≥ 4/5 points
- **Examples coverage**: ≥ 4/5 points

### **Stretch Goals**
- **Average score**: ≥ 90 points across all documents
- **Perfect scores**: 5/5 in Clarity, Structure, Completeness
- **Zero duplication**: 5/5 in DRY adherence
- **Industry reference**: Documentation suitable as external reference
