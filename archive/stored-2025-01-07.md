## Current Authoritative Documentation

The following files in `Conjecture/specs/` now contain the finalized and consolidated documentation:

- **design.md**: Complete system architecture and component design
- **requirements.md**: Comprehensive requirements and use cases
- **phases.md**: Development phases and implementation roadmap
- **interface_design.md**: Unified interface layer specifications

## Recommendations for Future Reference

### High Priority for Review
1. **EmbeddingMethods.py** - May contain useful implementation code
2. **EMBEDDING_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md** - Performance optimization strategies
3. **docs/system_design/** files - Detailed implementation guides
4. **EvidenceManagement.md** - Evidence system design patterns

### Medium Priority for Review
1. **ContextFlow_Implementation_Guide_2025.md** - Implementation patterns
2. **SIMPLE_EMBEDDING_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Embedding implementation examples
3. **ClaimProcessing.md** - Processing workflow patterns

### Low Priority for Review
1. **LLM_AGENT_RESEARCH.md** - Research background
2. **Documentation-*.md** files - Process documentation
3. **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Historical tracking

## Migration Notes

- All core concepts and designs have been incorporated into the current specs
- Code examples may need updates to match current architecture
- Some documents may contain outdated approaches that were superseded
- Performance optimization strategies remain valuable for implementation phase
