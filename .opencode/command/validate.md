Validate core hypothesis that Conjecture provides significant improvement in intelligence and truthfulness:

## Validation Process

1. Review current benchmarks:
   - Check recent test results
   - Analyze benchmark metrics
   - Compare to baseline

2. Identify gaps in validation:
   - What metrics are we missing?
   - What benchmarks need to be added?
   - What comparisons haven't been done?

3. Design validation experiments:
   - Propose specific benchmarks to run
   - Define success criteria
   - Outline expected vs actual results

4. Review existing evidence:
!`ls research/results/`
!`ls experiments/results/`

5. Provide assessment:
   - Current level of validation
   - Confidence in hypothesis
   - Next steps needed
   - Recommended benchmarks to run

Focus on quantifiable metrics that demonstrate intelligence and truthfulness improvements.
