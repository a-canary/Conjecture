Therefore, approval should be withheld until independent confirmation of benefit and cost\u2011effectiveness is obtained.",

Confidence is high.  \n- **c2**: Since the train covers the same distance each leg, the round\u2011trip distance is indeed twice the one\u2011way distance. Confidence is high.  \n- **c3**: Time for each leg is distance divided by speed. Summing the two gives the total time. This is a straightforward application of the distance\u2011time relationship.

Confidence is very high.  \n- **c5**: An arithmetic mean of 60 and 40 would give 50 mph, but that would incorrectly assume equal times at each speed.

What is the average speed for the entire round trip? Explain why the answer is not 50 mph.\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. First, generate 3-7 specific claims about the problem in this exact format:\n   [c1 | claim content | / confidence]\n   [c2 | claim content | / confidence]\n   etc.\n\n2. Then, evaluate each claim and provide a final answer based on your analysis.\n\nFormat your response with:\n- Claims section (using the exact format above)\n- Analysis section (evaluating each claim)\n- Final Answer section (your conclusion)",

It is incorrect because it treats the two speeds as if they were active for an equal amount of time. Average speed is not a simple average of speeds unless the time spent at each speed is identical. The confidence is low because it ignores the fundamental definition of average speed.\n\n*   **[c2]** This claim states the correct, universal formula for average speed. It is the foundational principle needed to solve the problem correctly. Any valid solution must be based on this relationship between total distance and total time.\n\n*   **[c3]** This claim explains the core reason why the simple average is wrong. Because the train travels the same distance at a slower speed, it takes longer to cover that distance. This longer duration means the slower speed has a greater \"weight\" in the overall average, pulling the final value down.\n\n*   **[c4]** This claim breaks down the \"total time\" component of the formula from c2. It correctly identifies that to find the total time, we must calculate the time for each part of the journey separately and then add them together.\n\n*   **[c5]** This claim applies the principles from",
