  "question": "Two cars are traveling to the same destination 201 miles away. Car A travels at an average speed of 49 mph, while Car B travels at 57 mph. How much longer does the slower car take to reach the destination? Express your answer in hours and minutes.",
  "ground_truth": "The slower car takes 0 hours and 34 minutes longer.\n\nSolution:\nTime for Car A = 201 \u00f7 49 = 4.10 hours\nTime for Car B = 201 \u00f7 57 = 3.53 hours\nTime difference = 0.58 hours = 0 hours and 34 minutes",
