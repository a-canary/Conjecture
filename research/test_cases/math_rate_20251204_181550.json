  "question": "Two cars are traveling to the same destination 260 miles away. Car A travels at an average speed of 75 mph, while Car B travels at 81 mph. How much longer does the slower car take to reach the destination? Express your answer in hours and minutes.",
  "ground_truth": "The slower car takes 0 hours and 15 minutes longer.\n\nSolution:\nTime for Car A = 260 \u00f7 75 = 3.47 hours\nTime for Car B = 260 \u00f7 81 = 3.21 hours\nTime difference = 0.26 hours = 0 hours and 15 minutes",
