  "question": "A rectangular garden has a length of 31 meters and a width of 12 meters. If you want to build a fence around the garden and cover the entire area with grass sod that costs $3 per square meter, what is the total cost for the sod and how many meters of fencing do you need?",
  "ground_truth": "The total cost for sod is $1,116.00 and you need 86 meters of fencing.\n\nSolution:\nArea = length \u00d7 width = 31 \u00d7 12 = 372 square meters\nSod cost = 372 \u00d7 $3 = $1,116.00\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (length + width) = 2 \u00d7 (31 + 12) = 86 meters",
