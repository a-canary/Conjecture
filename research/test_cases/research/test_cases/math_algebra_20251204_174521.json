  "question": "A farmer has a rectangular field that is 69 meters longer than it is wide. The farmer wants to divide the field into two equal rectangular sections by building a fence parallel to the width. If the total area of the field is 26,200 square meters and the fence costs $20 per meter, what is the total cost of the dividing fence?",
  "ground_truth": "The total cost of the dividing fence is $1,965.00.\n\nSolution:\nLet width = w meters, then length = w + 69 meters\nArea = w \u00d7 (w + 69) = 26200\nw\u00b2 + 69w - 26200 = 0\nUsing quadratic formula: w = [-69 \u00b1 \u221a(69\u00b2 + 4\u00d726200)]/2\nw = 131 meters\n\nDividing fence length = width = 131 meters\nCost = 131 \u00d7 $15 = $1,965.00",
