  "question": "A farmer has a rectangular field that is 31 meters longer than it is wide. The farmer wants to divide the field into two equal rectangular sections by building a fence parallel to the width. If the total area of the field is 16,530 square meters and the fence costs $22 per meter, what is the total cost of the dividing fence?",
  "ground_truth": "The total cost of the dividing fence is $1,710.00.\n\nSolution:\nLet width = w meters, then length = w + 31 meters\nArea = w \u00d7 (w + 31) = 16530\nw\u00b2 + 31w - 16530 = 0\nUsing quadratic formula: w = [-31 \u00b1 \u221a(31\u00b2 + 4\u00d716530)]/2\nw = 114 meters\n\nDividing fence length = width = 114 meters\nCost = 114 \u00d7 $15 = $1,710.00",
