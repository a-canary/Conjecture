  "question": "A farmer has a rectangular field that is 28 meters longer than it is wide. The farmer wants to divide the field into two equal rectangular sections by building a fence parallel to the width. If the total area of the field is 16,445 square meters and the fence costs $13 per meter, what is the total cost of the dividing fence?",
  "ground_truth": "The total cost of the dividing fence is $1,725.00.\n\nSolution:\nLet width = w meters, then length = w + 28 meters\nArea = w \u00d7 (w + 28) = 16445\nw\u00b2 + 28w - 16445 = 0\nUsing quadratic formula: w = [-28 \u00b1 \u221a(28\u00b2 + 4\u00d716445)]/2\nw = 115 meters\n\nDividing fence length = width = 115 meters\nCost = 115 \u00d7 $15 = $1,725.00",
