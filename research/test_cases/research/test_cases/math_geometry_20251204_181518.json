  "question": "A rectangular garden has a length of 49 meters and a width of 17 meters. If you want to build a fence around the garden and cover the entire area with grass sod that costs $3 per square meter, what is the total cost for the sod and how many meters of fencing do you need?",
  "ground_truth": "The total cost for sod is $2,499.00 and you need 132 meters of fencing.\n\nSolution:\nArea = length \u00d7 width = 49 \u00d7 17 = 833 square meters\nSod cost = 833 \u00d7 $3 = $2,499.00\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (length + width) = 2 \u00d7 (49 + 17) = 132 meters",
