  "question": "A rectangular garden has a length of 17 meters and a width of 6 meters. If you want to build a fence around the garden and cover the entire area with grass sod that costs $3 per square meter, what is the total cost for the sod and how many meters of fencing do you need?",
  "ground_truth": "The total cost for sod is $306.00 and you need 46 meters of fencing.\n\nSolution:\nArea = length \u00d7 width = 17 \u00d7 6 = 102 square meters\nSod cost = 102 \u00d7 $3 = $306.00\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (length + width) = 2 \u00d7 (17 + 6) = 46 meters",
