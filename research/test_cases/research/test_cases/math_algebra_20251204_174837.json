  "question": "A farmer has a rectangular field that is 44 meters longer than it is wide. The farmer wants to divide the field into two equal rectangular sections by building a fence parallel to the width. If the total area of the field is 4,700 square meters and the fence costs $17 per meter, what is the total cost of the dividing fence?",
  "ground_truth": "The total cost of the dividing fence is $750.00.\n\nSolution:\nLet width = w meters, then length = w + 44 meters\nArea = w \u00d7 (w + 44) = 4700\nw\u00b2 + 44w - 4700 = 0\nUsing quadratic formula: w = [-44 \u00b1 \u221a(44\u00b2 + 4\u00d74700)]/2\nw = 50 meters\n\nDividing fence length = width = 50 meters\nCost = 50 \u00d7 $15 = $750.00",
