  "context": "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While climate change is a natural phenomenon that has occurred throughout Earth's history, the current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely (greater than 95% probability) to be the result of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over millennia.\n\nThe primary cause of current climate change is the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). These gases trap heat from the sun that would otherwise escape into space, creating a greenhouse effect that warms the planet. Human activities such as burning fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, industrial processes, and agriculture have dramatically increased the concentration of these gases.\n\nThe effects of climate change are widespread and varied. Rising global temperatures cause polar ice sheets and glaciers to melt, leading to sea level rise that threatens coastal communities worldwide. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns affect agriculture, water supplies, and ecosystems. More frequent and intense extreme weather events, including hurricanes, droughts, heat waves, and heavy rainfall, cause significant damage to infrastructure, economies, and human health.\n\nScientists use various methods to study climate change, including direct measurements of temperature, atmospheric composition, and sea level; analysis of ice cores, tree rings, and sediment layers that provide historical climate data; and computer models that simulate future climate scenarios under different conditions. These multiple lines of evidence consistently show that Earth's climate is warming and that human activities are the primary driver.\n\nInternational efforts to address climate change include the Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Countries have pledged to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions through various strategies, including transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, protecting forests, and developing carbon capture technologies.\n\nThe impacts of climate change are not distributed equally. Developing countries, small island nations, and vulnerable populations often face the greatest risks despite contributing least to the problem. Addressing climate change requires both mitigation (reducing emissions) and adaptation (adjusting to changes that are already occurring), as well as international cooperation and equitable solutions.",
  "question": "Based on the text, what are the primary greenhouse gases contributing to climate change, and what are three major effects of climate change mentioned?",
  "ground_truth": "The primary greenhouse gases contributing to climate change are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Three major effects of climate change mentioned are: 1) Melting of polar ice sheets and glaciers leading to sea level rise that threatens coastal communities; 2) Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns that affect agriculture, water supplies, and ecosystems; and 3) More frequent and intense extreme weather events including hurricanes, droughts, heat waves, and heavy rainfall that cause damage to infrastructure, economies, and human health.",
