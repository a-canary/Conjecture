  "question": "A farmer has a rectangular field that is 41 meters longer than it is wide. The farmer wants to divide the field into two equal rectangular sections by building a fence parallel to the width. If the total area of the field is 7,412 square meters and the fence costs $22 per meter, what is the total cost of the dividing fence?",
  "ground_truth": "The total cost of the dividing fence is $1,020.00.\n\nSolution:\nLet width = w meters, then length = w + 41 meters\nArea = w \u00d7 (w + 41) = 7412\nw\u00b2 + 41w - 7412 = 0\nUsing quadratic formula: w = [-41 \u00b1 \u221a(41\u00b2 + 4\u00d77412)]/2\nw = 68 meters\n\nDividing fence length = width = 68 meters\nCost = 68 \u00d7 $15 = $1,020.00",
