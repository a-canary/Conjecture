  "question": "A farmer has a rectangular field that is 61 meters longer than it is wide. The farmer wants to divide the field into two equal rectangular sections by building a fence parallel to the width. If the total area of the field is 28,826 square meters and the fence costs $20 per meter, what is the total cost of the dividing fence?",
  "ground_truth": "The total cost of the dividing fence is $2,130.00.\n\nSolution:\nLet width = w meters, then length = w + 61 meters\nArea = w \u00d7 (w + 61) = 28826\nw\u00b2 + 61w - 28826 = 0\nUsing quadratic formula: w = [-61 \u00b1 \u221a(61\u00b2 + 4\u00d728826)]/2\nw = 142 meters\n\nDividing fence length = width = 142 meters\nCost = 142 \u00d7 $15 = $2,130.00",
