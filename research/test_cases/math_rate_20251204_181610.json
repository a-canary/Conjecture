  "question": "Two cars are traveling to the same destination 392 miles away. Car A travels at an average speed of 50 mph, while Car B travels at 62 mph. How much longer does the slower car take to reach the destination? Express your answer in hours and minutes.",
  "ground_truth": "The slower car takes 1 hours and 31 minutes longer.\n\nSolution:\nTime for Car A = 392 \u00f7 50 = 7.84 hours\nTime for Car B = 392 \u00f7 62 = 6.32 hours\nTime difference = 1.52 hours = 1 hours and 31 minutes",
