  "question": "A farmer has a rectangular field that is 60 meters longer than it is wide. The farmer wants to divide the field into two equal rectangular sections by building a fence parallel to the width. If the total area of the field is 8,509 square meters and the fence costs $19 per meter, what is the total cost of the dividing fence?",
  "ground_truth": "The total cost of the dividing fence is $1,005.00.\n\nSolution:\nLet width = w meters, then length = w + 60 meters\nArea = w \u00d7 (w + 60) = 8509\nw\u00b2 + 60w - 8509 = 0\nUsing quadratic formula: w = [-60 \u00b1 \u221a(60\u00b2 + 4\u00d78509)]/2\nw = 67 meters\n\nDividing fence length = width = 67 meters\nCost = 67 \u00d7 $15 = $1,005.00",
