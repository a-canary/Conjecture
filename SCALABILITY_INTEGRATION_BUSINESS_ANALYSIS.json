Achieving >70% on SWE-Bench-Bash-Only with GraniteTiny requires not just raw accuracy, but a solution that scales reliably, integrates cleanly with existing systems, and delivers measurable business value. The path from research prototype to production adoption depends on these three pillars working together.",
  
  "reasoning": "A solution that integrates cleanly, scales well, and delivers business value will see production adoption. This is the path from research to real-world impact. GraniteTiny's tiny footprint (1.3B parameters) makes it ideal for local deployment, but success requires: (1) Scalable architecture that handles concurrent requests without degradation, (2) Clean integration with CI/CD pipelines and existing tools, (3) Clear business case demonstrating ROI vs cloud alternatives ($0 local vs $200+ cloud per benchmark run).",
