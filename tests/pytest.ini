# Markers for test categorization
markers =
    unit: Unit tests for individual components
    integration: Integration tests for component interaction
    performance: Performance and benchmark tests
    slow: Tests that take longer to run
    asyncio: async test functions
    models: Tests for Pydantic models
    sqlite: SQLite manager specific tests

# Minimum test coverage requirements
# Starting with conservative thresholds and increasing over time
# Current goal: Progress toward 80% coverage

# Performance test settings
# Performance tests require the pytest-benchmark plugin
